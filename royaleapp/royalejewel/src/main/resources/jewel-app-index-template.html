      It is advisable that the main css is the first one (${application}.css = App.css). 
      If we use 'dynamic selectors', as for example in the bead 'ListAlternateRowColor' we will avoid problems.
      
      (When retrieving the css created dynamically with 'getClassStyle'. 
      'getClassStyle' is coupled to the “first” stylesheet referenced in the html template. 
      With the current implementation, if you have more than one, getClassStyle will fail to find the appropriate items 
      if the item being looked for is not within the first file)${body}
